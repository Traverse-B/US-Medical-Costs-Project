First, let's import our data into Python using the csv module and the method `DictReader()`, which will convert it into a list of Python dictionaries."

However, there is still some doubt about h5, our hypothesis that BMI of over 30 would have a significant effect on medical costs.  The average effect factor for BMI over 30 vs. under was around 1.5; however, the median effect was much smaller.  Some of the difficulty with our hypothesis is because the word *significant* is unspecific.  Is 1.5 a signficant effect?  We need a measure of the variability of the data to see if 1.5 is *statistically* significant.  We need a standard deviation!\n",
